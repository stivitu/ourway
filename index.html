		  We create dynamic websites, mobile software and simple applications for various purposes. 
		  Our business is web development. We welcome the development of new, open-source 
		  technologies and see our future in their application. One famous actor said: 
		  'People value you for how much money you take from them!' That is not our position. 
		  The Internet is changing - every day. User habits are changing
          available tools, work methods and service prices are changing.
          Despite all the changes and the dynamic environment, the user experience
          is in the forefront of our minds.
          Our goal is also to stay on the path that offers the maximum. How for us,
          as well as for clients.

		  We believe in the strength and power of individual work and the diligence and 
		  dedication of individuals. But we also believe in pooling that same potential, 
		  in order to better understand ongoing projects, and to share ideas and ways to 
		  approach the challenges ahead. There are talented individuals who make a huge 
		  contribution to development in all fields of human activity. But we also know 
		  that the greatest achievements are achieved by teams! 
		  Idea solutions and answers to questions can sometimes be found in the most 
          unexpected places. Therefore, we support diversity.
          If you have quality ideas, and if you are good in any segment of web development,
          join us. Together we can achieve more!

Today's Internet is a long way from what it was in
originally intended - and that is a FREE exchange of information.
This days, in order to find relevant information, you often have to search
a bunch of useless content, some of which are also dangerous for our computers.
And everything is sold. From information to programs that you will often
use that once and never again. I am also a user, and I know
which bothers me. First of all, in order to get some information, I have to
accept a bunch of "cookies", which later work in the background and slow down
my computer. Sites use all possible tricks to
get our e-mail addresses and personal data. All the time
they monitor our habits and activity on the Internet. We are sent advertising messages and e-mails,
for the suspension of which you sometimes need to spend an entire afternoon. None of us wants or needs that.
We need an internet with easily accessible information and easy to use.
Everyone wants to have their own framework, everyone says that their system is the best.
Which results in a lot of confusing material.
Does our landing page really have to be 200-300 mb!? I use on this page
only my own minified photos. The whole page will not have more
then 2 mb content. About useless content, in the form of completely useless videos,
barren self-promotion and sites that offer nothing, to say the least.
These "contents" only slow down the flow of information, take up space on servers,
whose fans do nothing but heat the atmosphere. And the responsibility is on all of us.
And that's why, as always, we have to start with ourselves. Use technology
which is made available to us reasonably and with measure - to begin with. I also see the solution in "light-weight"
applications, without unused installed packages, photos and other materials. Big companies
they only care about profit. We believe that we should also think about the happiness of the individual, care for society and the community
as well as environmental protection. In order for things to move in a more positive direction, we will not and cannot change the world.
But we can change ourselves, and act in the segment we have influence over. In order for our society to finally
become a happier society, and ultimately we would also have a faster, better and greener internet!
